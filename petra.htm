<font size="5">The ancient city of Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan’s southwestern desert. Petra is famous for its tombs, temples, churches and houses which are all carved into pink sandstone cliffs; earning its nickname, the “Rose City”. It’s Jordan’s most-visited attraction and part of the New 7 Wonders of the World. Established around 300 BC and only discovered by the western world in 1812. The indigenous people (Bedouin) of Petra were nomadic Arabs who used this city as a major trading hub. Petra became an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. The last indigenous Arabs slowly left Petra as the site became incredibly popular for thousands of tourists.

I stayed at Petra Gate Hotel in the small town of Wadi Musa which is just a few 100 metres away from the entrance of Petra. The hotel also offer lunch packages which you can bring with you to Petra. Very convenient as the restaurants inside Petra are touristy expensive. I only had 1 day for Petra which is way too short for this enormous site. Be prepared to walk and climb a lot if you want to get the most out of Petra. I had to squeeze everything into 1 day and doing so I ended up making 25 km to see the highlights of Petra. If you have more time I would advice to buy a multi-day ticket. Let me guide you through the fascinating world of Petra.
